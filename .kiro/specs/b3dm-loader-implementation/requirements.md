# B3DM Loader Implementation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a complete B3DM (Batched 3D Model) loader for the 3D Tiles library. The B3DM format is a core component of the OGC 3D Tiles specification, used for streaming batched 3D content efficiently. Our implementation will integrate seamlessly with the existing modular architecture while providing high-performance B3DM parsing and rendering capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: B3DM Format Support

**User Story:** As a developer using the 3D Tiles library, I want to load B3DM tiles so that I can display batched 3D models with optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a B3DM file is requested THEN the system SHALL parse the binary header correctly
2. WHEN parsing the header THEN the system SHALL validate magic number "b3dm" (0x6D643362)
3. WHEN parsing the header THEN the system SHALL extract version, byteLength, featureTableJSONByteLength, featureTableBinaryByteLength, batchTableJSONByteLength, and batchTableBinaryByteLength
4. WHEN header validation fails THEN the system SHALL throw a descriptive error
5. WHEN header is valid THEN the system SHALL proceed to extract embedded GLTF data

### Requirement 2: Feature Table Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the B3DM loader to process feature tables so that I can access per-feature metadata and properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feature table JSON exists THEN the system SHALL parse it as valid JSON
2. WHEN feature table binary exists THEN the system SHALL interpret it according to the JSON schema
3. WHEN BATCH_LENGTH is specified THEN the system SHALL validate it matches the expected batch count
4. WHEN RTC_CENTER is specified THEN the system SHALL apply relative-to-center transformations
5. WHEN feature table is malformed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information

### Requirement 3: Batch Table Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access batch table data so that I can apply per-batch styling and filtering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch table JSON exists THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the schema
2. WHEN batch table binary exists THEN the system SHALL correctly interpret typed arrays
3. WHEN batch properties are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide efficient lookup mechanisms
4. WHEN batch table contains hierarchical data THEN the system SHALL support nested property access
5. WHEN batch table is corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 4: GLTF Extraction and Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the B3DM loader to extract and process embedded GLTF data so that I can render 3D models with materials and animations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GLTF data is embedded THEN the system SHALL extract it from the correct byte offset
2. WHEN GLTF is GLB format THEN the system SHALL handle binary GLTF parsing
3. WHEN GLTF contains external references THEN the system SHALL resolve them relative to the B3DM base URL
4. WHEN GLTF processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide context about the failure location
5. WHEN GLTF is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL return Babylon.js compatible objects

### Requirement 5: Babylon.js Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using Babylon.js, I want B3DM content to integrate seamlessly with my scene so that I can use standard Babylon.js APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN B3DM is loaded THEN the system SHALL return BABYLON.AssetContainer objects
2. WHEN meshes are created THEN the system SHALL apply proper coordinate transformations
3. WHEN materials are processed THEN the system SHALL use Babylon.js PBR materials
4. WHEN animations exist THEN the system SHALL preserve animation data
5. WHEN textures are embedded THEN the system SHALL create Babylon.js texture objects

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer building large-scale applications, I want B3DM loading to be performant so that my application remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing large B3DM files THEN the system SHALL use streaming/chunked processing where possible
2. WHEN multiple B3DM files are loading THEN the system SHALL support concurrent processing
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement efficient buffer management
4. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL dispose of intermediate buffers
5. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL provide timing information

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling so that I can debug issues and handle edge cases gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN B3DM file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages
2. WHEN unsupported B3DM features are encountered THEN the system SHALL log warnings and continue
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL clean up allocated resources
5. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error information

### Requirement 8: Coordinate System Support

**User Story:** As a developer working with geospatial data, I want proper coordinate system handling so that my models are positioned correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RTC_CENTER is specified THEN the system SHALL apply relative-to-center transformations
2. WHEN coordinate system conversion is needed THEN the system SHALL support Y-up to Z-up conversion
3. WHEN geographic coordinates are used THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing coordinate utilities
4. WHEN transformations are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain precision for large coordinates
5. WHEN multiple coordinate systems are mixed THEN the system SHALL handle conversions consistently

### Requirement 9: Extensibility and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure B3DM loading behavior so that I can optimize for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom processing is needed THEN the system SHALL support callback functions
2. WHEN specific features should be disabled THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options
3. WHEN custom validation is required THEN the system SHALL support validation hooks
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options
5. WHEN performance tuning is required THEN the system SHALL expose relevant parameters

### Requirement 10: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable B3DM loading so that my application works consistently across different B3DM files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are run THEN the system SHALL pass all B3DM format validation tests
2. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL work with real-world B3DM files
3. WHEN performance tests are run THEN the system SHALL meet specified loading time benchmarks
4. WHEN memory tests are run THEN the system SHALL not leak memory during repeated loading
5. WHEN compatibility tests are run THEN the system SHALL work with various B3DM versions and extensions
